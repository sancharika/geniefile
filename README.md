**project vision:** to create a revolutionary ai-powered document assistant, a "magic lamp" for unlocking the secrets within your files.

**project goal:** develop a retrieval-augmented generation (rag) application, "genie file," that seamlessly integrates advanced information retrieval and natural language processing (nlp) techniques to deliver exceptional capabilities:

* **universal file support:** "genie file" will handle a wide range of document formats, including pdf, docx files, txt files, and more (future expansion planned). This ensures compatibility with your diverse digital library.
* **intelligent information extraction:** by leveraging powerful vector databases like faiss and knowledge graphs like neo4j, "genie file" will extract key information and relationships from your documents. imagine effortlessly uncovering critical facts, figures, and connections within your files.
* **intuitive question answering:** "genie file" will act as your ai-powered document oracle. formulate natural language questions, and "genie file" will delve into your documents to retrieve relevant and insightful answers. streamline your research and knowledge discovery.
* **advanced retrieval augmentation:** the rag architecture empowers "genie file" to not only retrieve pertinent information but also to generate comprehensive summaries, reports, and analyses based on your extracted data. translate raw document data into actionable insights and knowledge.
* **customizable knowledge graph:** neo4j's flexible knowledge graph capabilities allow you to tailor "genie file" to your specific needs. add custom entities, relationships, and domain-specific knowledge to refine its understanding of your documents and enhance its output.

**key features:**

* **file format agnosticism:** "genie file" will gracefully handle diverse file types, eliminating the need for format-specific tools.
* **vector vatabase power:** faiss ensures efficient and scalable information retrieval, enabling rapid searches through your document collection.
* **knowledge graph integration:** neo4j provides a robust framework for representing and understanding the relationships between concepts in your documents.
* **retrieval-rugmented generation:** the rag approach merges information retrieval with nlp-powered generation to deliver informative answers, summaries, and reports.
* **customizable knowledge graph:** adapt "genie file" to your domain by defining custom entities, relationships, and knowledge relevant to your field.
